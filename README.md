# CEDRA: Unleashing the Power of Cement, Dramatiq, and Grpc for Superior EDA Solutions!

<br/>

In an an Event-Driven Architecture ([EDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture)) world you need a fast and reliable development cycle even for small projects.

[Cement](https://builtoncement.com) is a well known [python](https://www.python.org) project and allows to build fast and super documented CLI apps with easyness.

The [Dramatiq](https://dramatiq.io) background task processing library in combination with [RabbitMQ Message Broker](https://www.rabbitmq.com) runs a reliable and solid EDA environment.

An integrated [Grpc](https://grpc.io) service gives access to the available tasks and workflows from outside.

Kickstart your EDA projects with Cedra and experience a seamless development cycle.

Cheers<br/>
Tom
